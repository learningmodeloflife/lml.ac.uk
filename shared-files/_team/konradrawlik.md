Dr. Konrad Rawlik is a pioneer in applying machine learning to genomics, with implications across the biology. As a Chancellor's Fellow at The University of Edinburgh, he develops innovative statistical and computational approaches to unravel the genetic basis and molecular mechanisms underlying complex biological processes. Dr. Rawlik's work, featured in Nature and Nature Genetics, bridges the gap between theoretical machine learning and practical genomic analysis.

Co-founding omecu, a spin-out company for secure, federated genomic data analysis, demonstrates Dr. Rawlik's commitment to translating academic insights into real-world applications. His expertise spans from individual genes to ecosystem-wide genetic interactions, providing a unique perspective on life's interconnected systems.

As LML's Chief Technical Officer, Dr. Rawlik will spearhead the development of our AI-driven platform for modeling life processes. His blend of academic rigor and entrepreneurial spirit is crucial for realising LML's vision of a comprehensive, cross-species biological model with applications ranging from medicine to environmental science and beyond.
