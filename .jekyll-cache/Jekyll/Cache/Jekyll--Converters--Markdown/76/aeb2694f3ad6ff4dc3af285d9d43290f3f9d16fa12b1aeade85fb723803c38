        <p><p>Kenny is Professor of Experimental Medicine, Co-director of the Baillie Gifford Pandemic Science Hub, and a consultant in critical care medicine at the Royal Infirmary, Edinburgh. He graduated from the University of Edinburgh in Physiology in 1999 and Medicine in 2002. He completed a PhD in statistical genetics before completing clinical training in intensive care medicine in 2014. After a period at the Broad Institute of Harvard and MIT, he returned to Edinburgh to establish a research programme using computational analyses of the human genome to understand and treat life-threatening infections. His discovery of a new genetic mechanism in Covid-19 led directly to an effective new treatment for the disease. He has been recognised with fellowship of the Royal Society of Edinburgh and the Academy of Medical Sciences, and is among the top 0.1% most highly-cited researchers worldwide across fields.</p>

        <p><p>Ian is Professor of Biomedical Informatics in the School of Informatics at the University of Edinburgh. As their Director he established two UKRI funded centres for doctoral training in Biomedical Artificial Intelligence (UKRI ¬£8m 2019-2027) and in AI for Biomedical Innovation (UKRI ¬£10m 2024-2032) that is delivering 120 state of the art research projects demonstrating the huge potential for AI to transform healthcare for the public good. He graduated from the University of Oxford with a B.A. and M.A. in Biochemistry (1995,1999) and a D.Phil. in Genetics (1999). He moved to Edinburgh to study neurological disease using statistical, machine, and deep learning approaches to unravel their underlying genetic and molecular basis. His work has developed new ways to model diseases using network structures to stratify patient groups and reveal underlying disease mechanisms. Working with the Simons Initiative for the Developing Brain and the Patrick Wild Centre in Edinburgh and supported by a Wellcome Trust Discovery Award (¬£5.5m 2023-2028) he is currently using biomedical natural language processing and graph neural network models to learn the relationships between genomic sequence variations and patient features in disease. He was elected an Alan Turing Institute Fellow in 2021.</p>

        <p><p>Konrad studied Mathematics and Artificial Intelligence at the University of Edinburgh, before obtaining an MSc by Research in developmental neuroscience and a PhD in machine learning. He then joined the Roslin Institute as a Core Scientist working on quantitative genetics in human. During this time, he developed and applied new statistical and computational approach to understand the genetic basis and molecular mechanisms underlying disease and other complex traits.</p>

<p>He has recently been awarded a Chancellor‚Äôs Fellowship, during which he will improve genotype to drug translation by developing new genetics based approaches to identify both, mechanistically homogenous sub-groups within disease populations and molecular mechanisms relevant to specific stages of disease progression.</p>

<p>He is also the co-founder of omecu, a spin-out company developing a platform for secure, federated, real-time interactive analysis of genomic data at scale.</p>
