                Founded in 2024, the Learning Model of Life is a cross-college initiative of The University of Edinburgh. We are a constituent of the University's Generative AI Lab (GAIL) and are supported by <a href="https://www.epcc.ed.ac.uk">EPCC</a>, the UK's leading centre of Supercomputing and Data Science. We are actively seeking partners to join our mission, commercial and philanthropic.
