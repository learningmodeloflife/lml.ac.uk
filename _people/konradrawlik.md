Konrad studied Mathematics and Artificial Intelligence at the University of Edinburgh, before obtaining an MSc by Research in developmental neuroscience and a PhD in machine learning. He then joined the Roslin Institute as a Core Scientist working on quantitative genetics in human. During this time, he developed and applied new statistical and computational approach to understand the genetic basis and molecular mechanisms underlying disease and other complex traits. 

He has recently been awarded a Chancellorâ€™s Fellowship, during which he will improve genotype to drug translation by developing new genetics based approaches to identify both, mechanistically homogenous sub-groups within disease populations and molecular mechanisms relevant to specific stages of disease progression. 

He is also the co-founder of omecu, a spin-out company developing a platform for secure, federated, real-time interactive analysis of genomic data at scale.
