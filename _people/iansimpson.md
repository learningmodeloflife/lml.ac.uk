Ian is Professor of Biomedical Informatics in the School of Informatics at the University of Edinburgh. As their Director he established two UKRI funded centres for doctoral training in Biomedical Artificial Intelligence (UKRI £8m 2019-2027) and in AI for Biomedical Innovation (UKRI £10m 2024-2032) that is delivering 120 state of the art research projects demonstrating the huge potential for AI to transform healthcare for the public good. He graduated from the University of Oxford with a B.A. and M.A. in Biochemistry (1995,1999) and a D.Phil. in Genetics (1999). He moved to Edinburgh to study neurological disease using statistical, machine, and deep learning approaches to unravel their underlying genetic and molecular basis. His work has developed new ways to model diseases using network structures to stratify patient groups and reveal underlying disease mechanisms. Working with the Simons Initiative for the Developing Brain and the Patrick Wild Centre in Edinburgh and supported by a Wellcome Trust Discovery Award (£5.5m 2023-2028) he is currently using biomedical natural language processing and graph neural network models to learn the relationships between genomic sequence variations and patient features in disease. He was elected an Alan Turing Institute Fellow in 2021.
