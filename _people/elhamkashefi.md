Elham Kashefi (FRSE) is Professor in Quantum Computing in Edinburgh, CNRS Professor at Sorbonne Paris, NQCC Chief Scientist and co-founder and CSO of VeriQloud. She has pioneered transdisciplinary research on the structure, behaviour, and interactions of quantum technology, from formal and foundational aspects all the way to actual industrial use-case delivery. Kashefi's research team innovates across a broad range of platforms (photonic, superconducting, ion trap) with an integrated software research programme (simulation, modelling and verification) delivering impact in quantum computing (machine learning, cryptanalysis) and quantum networks (quantum cryptography, quantum cloud computing) in a certifiable way (provable security, practical benchmarking, verification of computation).
