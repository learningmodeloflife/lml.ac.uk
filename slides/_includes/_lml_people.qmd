Kenny is Professor of Experimental Medicine, Co-director of the Baillie Gifford Pandemic Science Hub, and a consultant in critical care medicine at the Royal Infirmary, Edinburgh. He graduated from the University of Edinburgh in Physiology in 1999 and Medicine in 2002. He completed a PhD in statistical genetics before completing clinical training in intensive care medicine in 2014. After a period at the Broad Institute of Harvard and MIT, he returned to Edinburgh to establish a research programme using computational analyses of the human genome to understand and treat life-threatening infections. His discovery of a new genetic mechanism in Covid-19 led directly to an effective new treatment for the disease. He has been recognised with fellowship of the Royal Society of Edinburgh and the Academy of Medical Sciences, and is among the top 0.1% most highly-cited researchers worldwide across fields.

Filippo is the Director of Research at the Bayes Centre, the Innovation Hub for Artificial Intelligence and Data Science of the University of Edinburgh. A pioneer of the field of  “Cybergenetics”, the discipline at the interface of Machine Learning, Control Engineering and Synthetic Biology that seeks to model and control cellular dynamics, his group studies innovative foundation models for time series analysis and dynamical systems modelling. A former UKRI Innovation Fellow, his contribution to broader society spans the areas of fundamental research, entrepreneurship and policy. Filippo, a computer engineer by trade, holds a MBA in Finance and is a serial entrepreneur: over the past decade he founded or co-founded four new ventures and exited one. Leveraging his experience, he now acts as Board Member/Observer for startups/spin-outs in the UK and US and as Advisor for Venture Capital firms; he previously served as Investment Executive for Old College Capital, the Venture Capital arm of the University of Edinburgh, and Scientist in Residence for Equity Gap, one of the largest and most active Business Angels groups in the UK.
