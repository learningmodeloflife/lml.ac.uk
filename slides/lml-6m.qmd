# SET UP PROBLEM
- humility
- not often you get professors telling how little I know
==> consequences for me e.g. Jennifer

# OPPORTUNITY
- we have an instruction manual - but the problem is we don't know how to read it
- across all organisms
- AI can read it
- Can AI do anything? We know it can to this: we did it manually
- it worked

- it worked because we know biology. We knew where to look. GenOMICC vs the others

# FINISH WE CAN DO THIS AT SCALE
- trained on all organisms; impact on all organisms
- list impacts on real world chickens plants pathogens 


Sense of disruption
Transformative impact
Rock solid

Why can we do this? We're experts in every domain in biology


# KEY MESSAGES
- we're good at this
- unique data assets - UK MMC; current gap real tissue from humans
- the AI guys are trying to read this as if it were a language. biology-informed approach to model (hammer-nail)
    - sheet music ==> freddie
        - we know where to look; we're looking at the video of freddie, we're starting with the musicians, rather than trying to read it all from the sheet music

I'm a Professor of Experimental Medicine, I've got these degrees and awards. My job is to use biology to make the world better. But there's a problem.
I don't understand biology.

<!--

    We are building an autonomously-learning AI model of the molecular language underlying all life.
    I'd like to tell you a story to illustruate the power of the approach

    Which drug to choose?
    Our solution to that problem is an example of the power of computational predictions from the genome

    This example links a single gene, to a single molecule, in a single disease. 
    It has already saved tens of thousands of lives. 
    Imagine if we could do the same across many genes, many diseases, many species. 
    With your help, I believe we can.
