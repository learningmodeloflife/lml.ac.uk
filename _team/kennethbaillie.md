Professor Kenneth Baillie FRSE FMedSci is a computational biologist and critical care physician. As Professor of Translational Medicine at the University of Edinburgh and co-lead of the University's Baillie-Gifford Pandemic Science Hub, he pioneers research that bridges genomics, biology, and clinical practice. Professor Baillie's leadership of the world's largest genome-wide association study (GWAS) on critical illness has yielded transformative insights, contributing to breakthroughs like the discovery of baricitinib as a COVID-19 treatment. His work exemplifies the power of collaborative science, with applications extending beyond medicine to fields such as agriculture, environmental science, and biotechnology. With over Â£100 million in career funding and publications in Nature, Science, NEJM, and The Lancet, Professor Baillie's research has had major impact. As Co-Director of the Learning Model of Life (LML), Professor Baillie will leverage his expertise in genomics, data science, and cross-species biological insights to drive our mission of creating an autonomously-learning computational model of life.



<!--
	I am a clinician and computational biologist with a 15-year track record of developing and using machine learning methods to integrate data from different sources, generating important new understanding (see attached CV). I conceived and co-direct (with Mirella Lapata) the Learning Model of Life (LML) programme, a cross-college initiative in partnership with the Baillie Gifford Pandemic Science Hub, to build generative AI models of biology from molecular to whole-organism scale across all species. I intend LML to be a broad, inclusive initiative, drawing on expertise from medicine and biology, informatics, synthetic biology and engineering, and philosophy and ethics. I hope that it can be a significant and enduring contributor to the GAIL community.
